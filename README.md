## Learning Goals

I hope to continue buidling out my bioinformatics skillset, applying everything I have learned over the last few semesters into a real-world project. Specifically, I am interested in using math/programming to understand the body better, so I am hoping to be assigned to a project where I get to explore the modelling of a biological process, allowing for better understanding of how to leverage that process for good.
